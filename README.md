# datetime-logic

A Clojure library designed to extend Joda DateTime for use with core.logic.

What am I doing?  Even I'm not sure.  I started this project because I needed to be able to use date-times in logic programs.  So far I've met that goal, being able to unify vectors of logical variables with date-time objects (easily, thanks to the excellent example on the core.logic wiki).

What next, is a question I am still figuring out.  My main goal is to use this project for learning relational programming, particularly with core.logic and CLP/FD.  I was heavily motivated to finally finish the Reasoned Schemer before the Clojure/West Minikanran confo in March 2013.  It finally "clicked" for me, so now I am enthusiastically trying to do something with what I learned.  This project seemed like a good place to start because the domain (date and time) is complex enough to benefit from logic, but not so difficult that it will overwhelm me.  I would like to add some kind of novel capabilities here.  I have many sketchy ideas... we'll see.  At the very least, I want to iterate over the code until the language is clean and easy to import into other core.logic programs.

## Usage

You probably shouldn't use this yet.  Please come back soon!  I'm still figuring out what this should do, let alone how it should do it.  Expect frequent changes.
