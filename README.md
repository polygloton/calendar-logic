# datetime-logic

Datetime library for Clojure that uses core.logic.

What is this?

This is a Clojure library that allows queries to be run against the Gregorian calendar (and potentially other calendars in the future).

Why is this?

Mainly as an excuse for me to play with Clojure's core.logic.  Calendars seem like a great domain to experiment with logic programming.  Second, I hope that this becomes something useful, serving as a practical example of using core.logic in "the real world".

## Usage

This is actively being developed and isn't in a usable state (yet).
