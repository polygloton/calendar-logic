# datetime-logic

A Clojure library designed to extend Joda DateTime for use with core.logic.

Initially datetime-logic adds simple support for unifying vectors of vars against a DateTime.  DateTime objects must be on the left side of the unification.  In the future I plan to add more logical functions for working with time.

## Usage

Still in development.  Read the tests if you are curious enough.
